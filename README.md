# insight
Scala, Java, best practices, useful code snippets.

Ok. what's going on here?

The "Insight" project is the catalog of useful algorithms, programming techniques, best practices and code snippets.

In the upper level, the project is divided by categories according to programming languages: Scala, Java, JavaScript etc. 

Each article solves a certain issue, it's contained in a separate package (i.e one package, one article) and consists of README.md and source code files.
